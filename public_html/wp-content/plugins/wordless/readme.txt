Wordless is an opinionated WordPress plugin that dramatically speeds up and enhances your custom themes creation. Some of its features are:

* A structured, organized and clean [theme organization](https://github.com/welaika/wordless/tree/master/wordless/theme_builder/vanilla_theme)
* Bootstrap a new theme directly within wp-cli
* Write PHP templates with [Pug templating system](https://github.com/pug-php/pug)
* Write CSS stylesheets using the awesome [Sass syntax](http://sass-lang.com)
* Write Javascript logic in [Coffeescript](http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/)
* A growing set of handy and documented PHP helper functions ready to be used within your views
* Development workflow backed by [WebPack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack), [BrowserSync](https://www.browsersync.io/) (with live reload), [WP-CLI](http://wp-cli.org/), [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/). All the standards you already know, all the customizations you may need.

## Getting started

**Prerequisites**

1. Install WP-CLI http://wp-cli.org/#installing
2. Install global packages from NPM: `npm install -g foreman yarn`

Once done, considered you have a standard WordPress installation already up and running and you are in its root directory:

1. `wp plugin install wordless`
2. `wp plugin activate wordless`
3. `wp wordless theme create mybrandnewtheme`
4. `cd wp-content/themes/mybrandnewtheme`
5. `yarn install`

Now you have all you need to start developing ðŸ’»; just be sure to be in your theme directory and run

`yarn run server`

webpack, php server and your browser will automatically come up and serve your needs :)

== Upgrade Notice ==

= 0.5 =

* WARNING! Version 0.5 is not backward compatible! Wordless had always used `yield()` function in its template; starting from some point yield() become a reseved PHP function, so we had to rename it in Wordless code. If you get errors search and replace `yield()` inside the pugin directory with `wl_yield()`. Sorry for the inconvenient.
